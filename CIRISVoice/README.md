# CIRIS Voice Wyoming Bridge

This project provides a bridge between Home Assistant's voice assistant and the CIRIS ethical AI agent using the Wyoming protocol. It includes support for OpenAI or Google STT/TTS services and a simple client for the CIRIS API.

See `APIMODE.md` for details on communicating with the CIRIS API.
